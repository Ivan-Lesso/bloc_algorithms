> What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

When you can't sort the list. Example is random data that we for some reason can't sort.

> What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A binary search could be a list of numbers between 1 and 100 that we could sort.

> Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Linear search because we can't sort the list so binary search wouldn't be an option.

> Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary search because it will take fewer steps (due to sorting).
